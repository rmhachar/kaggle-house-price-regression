# kaggle_house_prices_regression
A Python script for the prediction of House Prices using regression techniques.

The competition can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.

This repo is split into two primary notebooks: one for performing EDA, and one for making predictions.

## The Data

The dataset for this notebook can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.

The training and testing sets are almost evenly divided and contain 1460 and 1459 rows, and 81 and 80 columns respectively.

This project consists of the following notebooks:

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing

Perform EDA and process the data so that predictions can be made.

## 2. Variable Selection with Principal Component Analysis

Use PCA to determine the optimal variables to use in a regression.

## 3. Regressions

Test various regression techniques against the processed dataset.

## 4. Creating a prediction using multiple models

Use multiple models to create a robust prediction.

## 5. Competition Submission

The full notebook used and submitted to the competition.
